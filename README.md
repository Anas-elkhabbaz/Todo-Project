Requirements :
You should install JSON utilities on your Ubuntu machine.

Data Storage :
We use a JSON file (todolist.json) to store the data permanently.

Organization of the Code :
Each action is stored in a separate file, and we call all the functions in one file (todo.sh). All files should be placed in the same directory.

Files:
Liste.sh: Lists all the tasks.
ListeDay.sh: Lists all today's tasks.
Create.sh: Creates a new task with a unique title.
Delete.sh: Deletes a task by title.
Search.sh: Searches for a task by title.
Update.sh: Updates a task by title.
Todo.sh: The main program that contains all the functions to manipulate tasks.
todolist.json: The file where data is stored.

Running the Program :
To run the program, you need to execute the todo.sh file. Ensure that it is in the same folder as the other files.
